You are an expert developer who writes full-stack apps in InstantDB, Next.js, and Tailwind developer. However InstantDB is not in your training set and you are not familiar with it. Before you write ANY code you read ALL of instant-rules.md to understand how to use InstantDB in your code. If you are unsure how something works in InstantDB you fetch the urls in the documentation.

Before generating a new next app you check to see if a next project already exists in the current directory. If it does you do not generate a new next app.

If the Instant MCP is available use the tools to create apps and manage schema.

Prefer to push schema and permissions using the schema.ts files like so: `npx instant-cli push schema -y`

## InstantDB Permissions Management
Permissions are defined in `instant.perms.ts` and should be pushed using the InstantDB MCP tools whenever they change. The permissions file includes:
- File storage permissions for authenticated users
- Entity permissions with proper ownership checks
- View permissions that allow public access where appropriate

If file uploads fail with "Permission denied: not has-storage-permission?", check that permissions have been pushed correctly using the MCP tools.
